## Work Experience
**Supply Chain Analyst Intern @ \
The Chemours Company (_January 2023 - May 2023_)**
- I enhanced logistics functions by improving cylinder return rates and generating critical reports. I upgraded the Bowersox Safety Stock Calculator using demand forecasting techniques, developed a SharePoint site for process control, and automated workflows using Alteryx and Power BI. My leadership in regional workshop preparation and data management, alongside creating impactful visualizations in Tableau, bolstered decision-making in cylinder management projects.

**Investment Research Analyst Intern @ \
AIDVP (_June 2022 - August 2022_)**
- I produced bi-weekly thematic investment publications, guided by macroeconomic events. I collaborated with peers for market insights and spearheaded a team of interns to research capital market strategies. My analytical skills were demonstrated by generating a CDS-basis monitor to gauge trading sentiment and by creating a dashboard highlighting prevalent research ideas, fostering a knowledge-sharing environment within the cohort.

## Projects
### Enhanced Prediction of Body Fat Percentage
[WOW Project](https://colab.research.google.com/gist/clay-lu/3b3b8e36a4bdc36eb86d0d61e57eb3ae/wow-project-notebook.ipynb)

This project aims to predict body fat percentage using various regression techniques including Multiple Linear Regression, LASSO Regression, Ridge Regression, Elastic Net Regression, and other machine learning algorithms. The dataset comprises physical measurements and body composition metrics. After extensive data preprocessing and model evaluation, the Random Forest Regressor demonstrated the best performance with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.488 and an R-squared value of 0.7655. These findings suggest that ensemble methods are effective in predicting body fat percentage, offering valuable insights for health and fitness assessments.

### Home Loan Prediction
[Home Loan Prediction](https://github.com/clay-lu/portfolio/blob/766fa72ccd0c68f94816569f4ae14c886be2ea26/D.S%20Final%20Project%20R%20Markdown-finalversion.Rmd)

The high default rates on home loans have several negative consequences nowadays. First, when borrowers default on their loans, the company incurs direct financial losses. These losses include the unpaid principal and interest, as well as costs associated with foreclosure and property management. Second, a high default rate increases the overall risk exposure of the company. This can lead to higher capital requirements and a need for more robust risk management strategies, which can be costly and resource-intensive. Third, consistently high default rates can damage the company’s reputation in the market. Customers may lose confidence in the company’s ability to manage loans effectively, which leads to a decline in new loan applications and customer retention.

This project is in response to the identified business problem: How can we enhance the precision of our home loan approval process to reduce defaults and minimize financial losses?
I proposed to enhance the risk measurements system to identify high-risk borrowers better, develop an advanced predictive model to predict loan defaults, etc.
